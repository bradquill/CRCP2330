/*This project proved harder to implement in Hack than I anticipated. The way I tried to increase the speed of the square over time proved very difficult without floating points because the numbers were increasing the speed way too quickly. Also the lack of String Concatenation proved very difficult for displaying the score but I believe I hacked around it. The only other problem I could not figure out was how to reset the direction to 0. Meaning when my new square is created it shouldn't be moving. Instead it takes on the direction of the previous square. */
